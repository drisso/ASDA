## My research interests

- **Statistical methodology**: modeling of high-dimensional data, parametric and non-parametric regression, clus-
tering, factor analysis and dimensionality reduction, multiple hypothesis testing, combining data from
multiple sources (meta-analysis).
- **Omics data analysis**: design and analysis of high-throughput gene expression experiments, analysis of
single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
- **Statistical software development**: author of >10 Bioconductor packages, member of the Bioconductor Technical Advisory Board.

## Program outline

### Statistical topics

1. (Everything is a) linear model
2. Experimental deisgn
3. The generalized linear model
4. Likelihood estimation and inference
5. Nonparametric methods: permutations and the bootstrap 
6. Multivariate analysis: PCA and more
7. Advanced statistical models: random effects, Bayesian models, discrete states, ...

## Program outline

### R topics

1. How to make engaging and informative plots
2. How to effectively "wrangle" data
3. How to make your analysis reproducible
4. Statistical modelling in practice

## Suggested materials

- **There is no textbook.**

- Lecture slides and the companion website are the main resources.

- In specific lectures I will give you additional materials, including suggested readings from books, journal articles, and more.

- If you are looking for a comprehensive book that covers most of the topic taught in this course, check out
[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/)

## Exam

- The exam will be in the computer lab, with R
- It will consist of both practical matters (data exploration and analysis) as well as theoretical questions
- The structure of the exam will be similar to the lab sessions
