# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is the companion website of the "Advanced Statistics and Data Analysis" course, taught within the ["Quantitative and Computational Biosciences" Master's program](https://www.unipd.it/en/educational-offer/second-cycle-degree/science?tipo=LM&scuola=SC&ordinamento=2024&key=SC2804&cg=science) at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/).

## Organization of this website

This website is organized as a book. Each class topic is treated in a different chapter.

In each Chapter, you will find the slides presented in class and the code used for the practicals.

You can use the navigation bar to navigate by topic or the Timeline section below to see the topics in the same order they were presented in class.
